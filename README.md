# Analysing-Flood-Risk-in-India

##Flood Prediction and Loss Assessment in India (1970–2023)

This project presents a machine learning–driven analysis of flood vulnerability and loss & damage (L&D) across Indian states from 1970 to 2023. It integrates hydrological, meteorological, and socio-economic datasets to improve flood prediction accuracy and inform disaster risk reduction strategies.

By applying advanced machine learning models such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), the study evaluates flood forecasting capabilities and their correlation with development indicators.

## Key Features

- Analyzes historical flood events in India (1970–2023)
- Utilizes diverse datasets: meteorological, hydrological, and topographical
- Implements machine learning models:
  - Random Forest  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - XGBoost  
  - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Evaluates flood predictions and regional risk mapping
- Correlates results with development factors (e.g., HDI, income levels)
- Concludes that:
  - Flood frequency and intensity are increasing
  - Current development strategies have limited impact on L&D reduction
  - ML-based disaster management systems offer strong potential for mitigation
